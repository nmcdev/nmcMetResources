>Welcome in the [PCTG R Markdown template](https://github.com/holtzy/epuRate). This document describes how the template looks like, building an interactive Manhattan plot.



# Loading data
***
Let's load a GWAS summary statistic stored in the [qqman library](https://github.com/stephenturner/qqman). This library is:

- Made by Stephen Turner
- Good to plot a quick Manhattan plot

```{r, message=FALSE}

```



# Show data in a table
***
It's often handy to keep a trace of the raw data somewhere in your document. The DT library allows to build interactive tables that you can search, filter, highlight and more.
```{r}

```



# Manhattan plot
***
Using `HTML` outputs you can embed some interactive graphics. For example, the plotly library can transform any of your ggplot2 graphic in an interactive chart:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
